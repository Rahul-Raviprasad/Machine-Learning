## Neural Networks

These are simplified models of the biological nervous system and therefore has drawn inspiration for the human brain.

An NN, in general, is a highly interconnected network of a large number of processing elements called neurons, in an architecture inspired by the brain. A NN can be massively parallel exhibiting parallel distributed computing.

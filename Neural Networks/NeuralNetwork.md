## Neural Networks

These are simplified models of the biological nervous system and therefore has drawn inspiration for the human brain.

An NN, in general, is a highly interconnected network of a large number of processing elements called neurons, in an architecture inspired by the brain. A NN can be massively parallel exhibiting parallel distributed computing.

#### Characteristics
1. Fault tolerant: Imagine if we loose few neurons in our brains, still it will not have a catastrophic impact it may cause some delay in the processing.
2. Robust: They can recall full patterns from partial, incomplete or noisy patterns.
3. Mapping capability: They can map input patterns to their associated output patterns.
4. Pattern association
5. Parallel, high speed and distributed.
 
#### Well known Neural network systems
1. Perceptron
2. Back propagation network
3. ADALINE(Adaptive Linear Element)
4. associative memory
5. Botlzmann machine

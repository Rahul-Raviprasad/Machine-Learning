# Confusion Matrix

A confusion matrix is an N X N matrix, where N is the number of classes being predicted.

## Metrics
* Accuracy : the proportion of the total number of predictions that were correct.
* Positive Predictive Value or Precision : the proportion of positive cases that were correctly identified.
* Negative Predictive Value : the proportion of negative cases that were correctly identified.
* Sensitivity or Recall : the proportion of actual positive cases which are correctly identified.
* Specificity : the proportion of actual negative cases which are correctly identified.
